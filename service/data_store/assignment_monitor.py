"""Monitors creation of assignments.

The assignment monitor allows for two kinds of monitoring:

* Monitoring on acquired assignments: A process that acquires an assignment,
  will only receive notifications for episode chunks that have been added to
  that assignment.

  Strong guarantees apply in this case: This is a producer-consumer scheme
  in which there's only one consumer at a time (acquiring an assignment is
  exclusive). All new chunks will be consumed by the consumer process,
  and in a transition from one consumer process to another, each chunk will be
  sent to either process, but no chunk will be sent to both. The only exception
  to this is when release_assignment isn't called (for example in the case
  of a crash), in which case notifications will be sent again to the next
  process.

  The notifications on acquired assignments can be taken to mean "this
  assignment has new training data available", and since acquiring is
  exclusive, the process can start training on that data right away knowing
  no other process will do the same.

* Monitoring on all assignments: A process that hasn't acquired an
  assignment will receive notifications for all assignments with
  new episode chunks (excluding assignments that are already acquired by other
  processes).

  This kind of monitoring is like a broadcasting system for multiple
  listeners. It provides very weak guarantees: A process that
  received a notification of this kind can't tell for sure another process
  won't train on the new data before it does.

  So a client that receives a notification of this kind can try to acquire
  the corresponding assignment. If that succeeds, they must wait for
  notifications of new chunks; such a notification would confirm that there's
  new data that hasn't been used for training before, and that the client
  has a lock that allows it to train on the data.

Monitoring is implemented as files and locks that are accumulated on the
notification directory. Monitoring on all assignments only reads these files,
and keeps track of state internally (hence the lack of guarantees). Monitoring
on acquired assignments locks assignments for writing, which allows is to
clean up the notification files and provide stronger guarantees.
