  """Select the model with highest upper confidence bound on success rate.

  Models can viewed as Bernoulli distributions with a fixed but unknown success
  rate. We can model the uncertainty of the actual success rate as a Beta
  disribution Beta(A, B) where A and B are incremented with each sucessful and
  unsuccessful trials respectively. The initial values for A and B are set to
  0.5, which corresponds to the Jeffreys prior for the beta distribution. This
  prior experimentally performs better than other obvious choices, e.g.,
  1. This means, that the unknown success rate of a model with X successes and
  Y failures is represented as the Beta distribution Beta(0.5 + X, 0.5 + Y).

  When we model an unknown success rate as a distribution Beta(A, B) we can
  calculate a confidence interval on the success rate. For example, for 1
  success and 1 failure, the 90% confidence interval for the success rate,
  modeled by Beta(1.5, 1.5) is approximately [10%, 90%].

  The UCBSampling strategy selects the model for deployment that has the
  highest upper confidence bound. A high upper confidence bound can both mean
  that we are confident that the model has a high success rate, e.g., if the
  confidence interval is [0.9,0.95] or that we are highly uncertain about how
  good the success rate is, e.g., [0.35, 0.95]. This means that sampling focuses
  on obtaining more information on models that are promising candidates for
  being the best model.

  We use sampling to estimate the confidence interval using a relatively low
  number of samples. This seems to work better empirically for the overall
  selection procedure than calculating a more accurate interval.
