"""Methods that operator on nests of Tensor instances.

A tensor nest is a dictionary tree where the leaves are Tensor instances.

For example:

n = {'a': {'b': tf.constant([1, 2, 3]), 'c': tf.constant([3, 4])}}

is a nest where n['a']['b'] references tensor [1, 2, 3] and n['a']['b']
references tensor [3, 4].

  Returns:
    Nest (dictionary tree) of outer most dimensions (batch sizes) of each tensor
