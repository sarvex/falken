  """Translates an ego-centric signal to a camera-relative control frame.

  This takes a 2D directional control signal indicating a direction on the XZ
  axis of the controlled entity and translates it into the camera frame.
  Informally, the output will be (0, 1) if the control signal points away from
  or up relative-to the camera, and it will be (1, 0) if it points right
  relative to the camera.

  The signal is computed as follows: First, the camera-relative (0, 1) signal is
  projected onto the XZ plane of the controlled object by finding the
  intersection of the camera YZ plane with the controlled object's XZ plane.
  We then determine the angle alpha between this projected vector and the
  egocentric control signal. To obtain the camera-relative output signal,
  we rotate (0, 1) by the same angle alpha.

  For example, assume a top down camera, a controlled entity that is yawed by
  90 degrees (i.e., facing east) and a control signal of (1, 0), indicating a
  desired direction of "go right relative to current eastward facing" which is
  equivalent to "go south". Then the intersection of the camera YZ plane and
  the player XZ plane yields the vector (0, 0, 1), i.e., pushing forward should
  make the player move north. Since the egocentric control signal indicates a
  movement direction of 'south' the angle is 180 degrees. So, to obtain the
  camera-relative output signal, we rotate (0, 1) by 180 degrees and obtain
  (0, -1).

  Note that the magnitude of the output signal is the same as that of the
  input signal.
